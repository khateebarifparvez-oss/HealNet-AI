üîç **Potential Profession-Related Health Factors:**

1. **Sedentary Lifestyle**: Lecturing often involves long hours standing or sitting, which can contribute to:
   - Weight gain and metabolic issues
   - Back and joint pain
   - Poor circulation

2. **Voice Strain**: Frequent speaking can lead to:
   - Throat irritation
   - Vocal cord strain
   - Chronic hoarseness

3. **Mental Stress**: Academic pressures may cause:
   - Anxiety and stress-related symptoms
   - Sleep disturbances
   - Headaches and tension

4. **Irregular Schedule**: Teaching schedules can disrupt:
   - Sleep patterns
   - Eating habits
   - Exercise routines

üí° **Suggestions for Lecturers:**
- Take regular movement breaks during classes
- Practice voice care and hydration
- Implement stress management techniques
- Maintain work-life balance
- Consider ergonomic teaching setups

However, I cannot provide specific medical advice about your symptoms. The chest pain and palpitations you mentioned particularly warrant medical evaluation. Please consult with a healthcare provider who can assess your specific situation.`;

I strongly recommend consulting with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation of these symptoms. They may suggest tests like an ECG, stress test, or blood work to determine the cause.

In the meantime, try to:
- Avoid strenuous activity
- Practice deep breathing exercises
- Reduce caffeine intake
- Monitor when symptoms occur

Please seek medical attention promptly for chest pain.`;

For health concerns related to your symptoms (chest pain, palpitations, headaches, numbness), it's important to:

1. Consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis
2. Keep a symptom diary noting when symptoms occur
3. Follow up with recommended medical tests
4. Discuss your lifestyle factors and profession with your doctor

Your symptoms, particularly chest pain and numbness, should be evaluated by a medical professional to rule out any serious conditions.
